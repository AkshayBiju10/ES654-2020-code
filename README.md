### Questions

1. Complete the decision tree implementation in tree/base.py. The code should be written in Python and not use existing libraries other than the ones already imported in the code. Your decision tree should work for four cases: i) discrete features, discrete output; ii) discrete features, real output; iii) real features, discrete output; real features, real output. Your decision tree should be able to use GiniIndex or InformationGain as the criteria for splitting. Your code should also be able to plot/display the decision tree. **[4 marks]**
