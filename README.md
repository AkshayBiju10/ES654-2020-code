### Questions

1. Complete the decision tree implementation in tree/base.py. **[4 marks]**
The code should be written in Python and not use existing libraries other than the ones already imported in the code. Your decision tree should work for four cases: i) discrete features, discrete output; ii) discrete features, real output; iii) real features, discrete output; real features, real output. Your decision tree should be able to use GiniIndex or InformationGain as the criteria for splitting. Your code should also be able to plot/display the decision tree. You should be editing the following files.

    - `metrics.py`: Complete the performance metrics functions in this file. 

    - `usage.py`: Run this file to check your solutions.

    - tree (Directory): Module for decision tree.
      - `base.py` : Complete Decision Tree Class.
      - `utils.py`: Complete all utility functions.
      - `__init__.py`: **Do not edit this**

You should run _usage.py_ to check your solutions. 

2. Show the usage of your decision tree on the IRIS dataset. The first 70% of the data should be used for training purposes and the remaining 30% for test purposes. Show the accuracy of the decision tree you implemented on the test dataset. **[1 mark]**
